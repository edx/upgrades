# GitHub Workflow only has string type input field available as an argument
# so it is not possible to pass the issue_body as parameter
# In case a different issue body is required than the one hard coded, then
# Update the workflow with the updated issue body description, then
# 1. either merge the workflow and then trigger the workflow
# 2. or use the changed branch when triggering the action instead of main branch
